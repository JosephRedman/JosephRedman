# Joseph Redman
## About Me
Hello! I'm Joseph Redman, a tech enthusiast with a strong passion for programming and electronics design. My journey spans various platforms, including Python, Linux, and the BBC Micro, alongside extensive work with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Iâ€™m currently exploring programming languages by creating a custom language, Nest, which combines simplicity with functionality. My other ongoing projects include a plotter controller, a Python-based UI environment, and a web server running on a Raspberry Pi to monitor system performance.

## Projects
**Nest Language**: A custom programming language I've created with core commands for variable manipulation, math, and I/O.
**Arduino Plotter**: A CNC-style plotter that executes G-code commands using an Arduino and servos for precise control.
**Linux Server Management**: Hosting a website on my Raspberry Pi, managing NGINX, Samba, and a live performance monitoring system.

## Tech Stack
**Languages**: Python, C/C++, HTML, CSS
**Platforms**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Linux, WordPress
**Tools**: VSCode, Onshape (CAD), Pygame, Micro
**Interests**: CNC, CAD, and microcontroller-based projects
